This file contains commonly asked interview questions and answers for Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (LSSGB) certification.

---

## 🟢 Beginner Level

1. **What is Lean Six Sigma?**  
   **Answer:** Lean Six Sigma is a methodology that combines Lean principles (waste reduction) and Six Sigma techniques (variation reduction) to improve processes.

2. **What is the DMAIC framework?**  
   **Answer:** DMAIC stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control – a structured approach for process improvement.

3. **What is a process?**  
   **Answer:** A process is a sequence of activities that converts inputs into outputs.

4. **What are the types of waste in Lean?**  
   **Answer:** TIMWOOD – Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects.

5. **What is a Kaizen event?**  
   **Answer:** A Kaizen event is a focused, short-term improvement project to solve a specific problem.

6. **What is a Control Chart?**  
   **Answer:** A Control Chart monitors process variation over time and detects if it is stable or needs correction.

7. **What is a Green Belt?**  
   **Answer:** A Green Belt is a professional trained to lead process improvement projects using Lean Six Sigma tools.

8. **Difference between Lean and Six Sigma?**  
   **Answer:** Lean focuses on speed and waste reduction; Six Sigma focuses on reducing variation and defects.

9. **What is a process capability (Cp, Cpk)?**  
   **Answer:** Process capability measures how well a process meets specifications and tolerances.

10. **What is FMEA?**  
    **Answer:** Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) identifies potential failure modes and their effects on the process.

## 🟡 Intermediate Level

1. **What is a Value Stream Map (VSM)?**  
   **Answer:** A visual tool showing all steps in a process, highlighting waste and improvement opportunities.

2. **What is Poka-Yoke?**  
   **Answer:** Error-proofing technique to prevent mistakes in a process.

3. **Difference between CTQ and KPI?**  
   **Answer:** CTQ (Critical to Quality) is customer-focused requirement; KPI (Key Performance Indicator) measures performance.

4. **What is process sigma level?**  
   **Answer:** It indicates the performance of a process by the number of defects per million opportunities (DPMO).

5. **What is a Pareto Chart?**  
   **Answer:** A chart that identifies the most significant factors in a dataset using the 80/20 rule.

6. **Difference between qualitative and quantitative analysis?**  
   **Answer:** Qualitative analysis uses descriptive data; quantitative analysis uses numerical data and statistics.

7. **What is hypothesis testing in Six Sigma?**  
   **Answer:** A method to determine if there is a significant difference or relationship between data sets.

8. **What is Regression Analysis?**  
   **Answer:** A statistical tool to find relationships between variables and predict outcomes.

9. **Difference between process control and process improvement?**  
   **Answer:** Process control ensures stability; process improvement increases efficiency and reduces defects.

10. **What is a Kaizen Burndown Chart?**  
    **Answer:** A visual tool to track improvement activities and completion during a Kaizen event.

## 🔴 Advanced Level

1. **What is Design of Experiments (DOE)?**  
   **Answer:** DOE is a structured method to determine relationships between factors affecting a process and the output.

2. **Difference between single-factor and multi-factor DOE?**  
   **Answer:** Single-factor tests one variable at a time; multi-factor tests multiple variables simultaneously.

3. **What is a Control Plan?**  
   **Answer:** A document defining monitoring and control methods to maintain process improvements.

4. **How do you calculate process capability index (Cpk)?**  
   **Answer:** Cpk = min[(USL – mean)/3σ, (mean – LSL)/3σ], where USL/LSL are upper/lower limits and σ is standard deviation.

5. **What is Statistical Process Control (SPC)?**  
   **Answer:** SPC uses statistical methods to monitor and control a process.

6. **Difference between Type I and Type II error?**  
   **Answer:** Type I rejects a true hypothesis; Type II fails to reject a false hypothesis.

7. **What is a hypothesis in Six Sigma?**  
   **Answer:** An assumption about the process that can be tested using data.

8. **How do you identify critical Xs in a process?**  
   **Answer:** Using tools like Fishbone diagram, Pareto chart, regression, and DOE analysis.

9. **What is Lean Six Sigma project charter?**  
   **Answer:** A document defining project scope, objectives, team roles, and expected benefits.

10. **What is the difference between Green Belt and Black Belt roles?**  
    **Answer:** Green Belts lead projects part-time; Black Belts lead larger projects full-time and mentor Green Belts.
